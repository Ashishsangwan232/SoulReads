                SoulReads is not just a website â€” it's a reflection a personal journey. Iâ€™m <strong>Ashish Sangwan</strong>, the founder of this platform.
                Iâ€™ve always had a mind full of thoughts â€” some random, some meaningful. Many of those deeper thoughts would disappear too quickly,
                and I started wondering how many others feel the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thatâ€™s when the idea of SoulReads came alive â€” a calm, focused space where anyone can write down their thoughts, 
                personal stories, or reflections before they fade away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m not a writer by profession, but Iâ€™ve always been curious and introspective. I also dream of reading more books and 
                writing what I genuinely feel and learn from them. Thatâ€™s why this platform includes book reviews too â€” not as expert critiques, 
                but as personal viewpoints that come from the heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                If youâ€™ve ever had thoughts you didnâ€™t want to lose, or books you wanted to explore more deeply, 
                then SoulReads is for you â€” just as much as it's for me.
